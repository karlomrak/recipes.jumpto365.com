# Recipes

Looking into the mirror I see at least two things: 

1. A person looking like Ernest Hemingway, but with a beard
2. A person still with a lot of appetite for learning and sharing knowledge

I have been working with IT since mid 1980's. I have been working with Microsoft technologies since 1995. I have been working with Microsoft Azure and Office 365 since 2011, become the platforms even got their current brand names. I have been working with Microsoft Power Platform since 2016, and are a member of Microsoft Community Board for Power tools.

## BPOS & Office 365
Six years a go I go appointed technical lead of Office 365 and Azure AD in the company which I still work for. I establish a community in Denmark supported by Microsoft, which had participation from the majority of companies in the financial sector in Denmark. 

I have decided that now is the time to step up and start sharing my knowledge with the world. I have decided to start a blog, and I have decided to start with a series of recipes. Having world class support from my friend and business partner Matt Wade @thatmattwade, I have gained the confidence to start this journey.

## Matt Wade
Matt and I met online almost 5 years a go. I was looking for a way to visualize the many tools of Office 365. When I saw Matt's Periodic Table of Office 365 I was sold. At that time, I had been developing smaller solutions for Office 365 and Azure AD, but I had not yet started tried to make an app for a global audience.


## jumpto365.com
What I did was to make a mock up of a web version of the Periodic Table, which I shared with Matt on LinkedIn. Matt was impressed, and we started a conversation. We decided to work together, and we have been working together ever since. Spring 2018 I flew to Washington DC to meet Matt in person. We had a great time, and managed to formulate a letter of intent, for a partnership. Later we formalized the partnership, and established jumpto365, Inc.
