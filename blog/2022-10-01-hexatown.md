# Hexatown

Hexatown is an experimental project which I have been working on now and then. I had the idea of coming up with a Command Line Interface (a CLI) which would make my life simpler when acting as a mentor for student worker and young graduates.

I actually managed to make what I consider at powerfull CLI out of that, with an installation technique heavily inspired by chocolatey

 %windir%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Command "[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 3072;iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://hexatown.com/install'))"
```
