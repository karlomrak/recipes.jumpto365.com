# Recipes for PowerApps

I have started to compile a list of best practices, tips and tricks which can support you in making PowerApps yourself. The ambition is to avoid having to invest in expensive licenses or consumption heavy (and costly) data platforms. Basically everything that you can do with Office 365 connectors and Lists will be covered. 

PowerApps can do so much more, model driven apps with rich data integrations etc. But it comes with cost that might end getting huge on life cycle management and operations. And bare in mind, PowerApps was never designed from the ground up to be a multi-developer platform with rich application life cycle management support, so I will not try to follow Microsoft recommendations here but look for traditional ways of handling more complicated solutions.

## Micro Apps
What are micro apps?
A micro app is purposefully designed to accomplish a single, UI-related application task. Rather than rewrite the same piece of user interface for an application, developers can configure an existing micro app to meet their needs. This helps ensure consistency across user interface experiences, and it provides a quick way to extend and customize individual UIs.
